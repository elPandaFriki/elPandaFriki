### Now that we are on the same page, let's start.

`HELLO WORLD!` I'm David Perera. I'm a Software Engineer from the warm lands of Spain. I've been coding for a while now and managed to land a good, comfy place with some languages. Here, let me show you with a **table**:
| Language      | Comfiness     | Awesomeness  |
| :------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| JavaScript    |        9      |       8      |
| TypeScript    |        6      |       5      |
| Python        |        5      |       5      |
| C             |        7      |       5      |


You'll be asking yourself some stuff like:

> _Why do i care?_

> _Why should i get into contact?_

> _Why is this handsome person guessing correctly all my questions?_


## I'll answer you the big question:
![WHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/GfoDjZTiHuIU/giphy.gif)

You are in front of a:
1. Seasoned young programmer with several years of **production focused coding experience** behind of him
2. Person with a career focused on **UI/UX**
3. Team-work guy with **strong leadership abilities** (Up to 2 persons for now!)
4. **Proactive man**, always looking on how to improve performance and features
5. **Boosting capacity and good quality**. For the code part I mean ;)

If you don't believe me, here I am on my day-to-day work:
